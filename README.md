The LavaFrame project is based on [this](https://github.com/knightcrawler25/GLSL-PathTracer) GLSL path tracing project by knightcrawler25 - differences from the original include :
- New UI
- More export options
- CLI parameter control
- Tonemapping
- OIDN upgrade
- [Blender Integration (WIP)](https://github.com/LavaFrame/LavaFrame-Blender-Integration-Addon)
- Build automation (currently only on MSBuild - this will be changed later on.)
- Some other stuff I forgot.
